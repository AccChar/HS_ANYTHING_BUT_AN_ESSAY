<center> <br><br><br><br><br><p class=dog> As you read through the novel you come across a multitude of different themes and lessons. 
The message that we will be going over is one that is a pivotal point in the novel and is still applicable even in modern society. 
That message is that racial prejudice combined with a social acceptance for that prejudice leads to injustice and very biased decisions in the 
judicial system. </center>

<center> The trial of Jefferson was an event that sent shockwaves through the rest of the novel, determining all of the main characters as well as
    the side characters' journeys. The jury for Jefferson was all white and they didn't care much for actual justice but for someone to pay and 
Jefferson was the poor man that they could easily place blame on. The reason that the jury is able to do this is because of how much racial prejudice
was acceptable back then, this racial prejudice led to biased decisions which is the adverse principal of a fair judicial system. Jefferson was
wrongly put to death because he was poor, black, and uneducated but the biggest factor out of those three was that he was a black man. During that
time nobody would care much if a black man was put to death or wrongly imprisoned for any amount of time as it was a social norm and racism was widely
celebrated and very apparent.     </center>

Before Jeffersons trial even started everybody knew that he would be convicted and be found guilty. Jeffersons trial is applicable to todays modern society
as according to <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-row/overview/demographics">deathpenaltyinfo.org </a>  people who are black almost match
people who are white on a 1:1 scale which is very significant as there are lots more white people in the U.S than there are black people.
The reason for this is because racial prejudice is instilled in us at a young age, no matter if we want to accept that or not it is fact due to the
media's portrayal of minorities. Also, racism isn't nearly as widely accepted but that doesn't mean that it still plays a key part in our judicial system.
A modern day example of a trial similar to Jeffersons is the one of Earl washing Jr. who was falsey convicted of murder and rape charges in 1984 but unlike
Jefferson he was exonerated of these charges in 2000. Although his death sentence was not carried out it is still a big deal that he even was convicted, he had the IQ of a 10 year old
and was black which are two factors that he shared with jefferson. We feel that this event in the novel is one of the strongest messages throughout it as
even though the novel takes places quite a while before us it is still extremely relevant.
